# Fable WebGL

Live version: http://davidtme.github.io/webgl/index.html

A demo [Fable](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable) project that shows how to control a WebGL and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) client using [Fable Elmish](https://github.com/fable-compiler/fable-elmish)

This tries to follow the Elm architecture in were a `model` is controlled by messages to an `update` function.  This model is presented to the React and WebGl views that render different parts. 

Please feel free to comment.  I'm happy to convert this into some sort of Fable 2D spite library if anyone would be interest.
